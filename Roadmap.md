# Spine-cpp roadmap

This is a list of upcoming features sorted roughly by priority.

~~A striked out feature~~ means that it has recently been added.

* Binary file loader
* Cache local timelines and timeline allocator (would lead to faster animation update)
* `const char*` overloads for most `std::string` arguments to avoid needless allocations
* ~~Functionality to remove duplicate timeline frames (would lead to faster animation update)~~
* Demo project
* Allow custom allocators
* Documentation
